# R_Project
Using R for data wrangling, analysis and visualization - Data Project Groups of three students cooperate on an exploratory analysis of a complicated data set during the four weeks of the course. The group creates a concise data journalistic product (HTML, PDF, or Word; static, dynamic, or interactive) that presents interesting findings from the complicated data set as data visualizations. The data visualizations are aimed at a general audience, like a blog post. The product contains a minimum of accompanying text required to understand the contents and limitations of the data visualizations. Each group member is responsible and graded for one data visualization. The product is submitted as a fully reproducible R Markdown document (containing all steps from the original data to the data visualizations) and it is presented to the group in a pitch.  The data set can be picked from a precompiled list on this Canvas site or data can be selected by the students themselves. See the bottom of the precompiled list on this Canvas site for data set requirements.  Prerequisites:  Submission: The R Markdown file is submitted timely. Authorship: Each data visualization must show the data source and the author (student). Cooperation: The report was prepared as a single R Markdown document.
